# Bubble Sort Kata 1.

Given an array of X elements sort it using the bubble sort algorithm

Steps:
create a function that takes in a slice of integers

Iterate through the slice and for each element compare if it is greater than the next if it is swap places until the end of the file repeat for N elements.

We have to iterate for every integer so we are running this N times and it must compare to N elements meaning the time compelxity is O(N^2)
