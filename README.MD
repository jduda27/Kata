# My Dojo

To begin this repository is a home to my personal practice plan, my kata. The goal here is to create a basic
and easily scheduled practice plan. Each Kata will start with a problem relating to the data structure or
algorithm.

Although this is a good practice for learning a new language and keeping consistent on how to implement various 
data structures and algorithms, the primary focus for future development is implementing and understanding how
these solutions can be applied in practice.

The kata is the ground work to solve future problems.

## Ranking
This section exists to order dfferent algorithms and data structures by complexity to implement.
For planning purposes we should kata the more complex problems more frequently than the easy to
implement and least complex solutions.
